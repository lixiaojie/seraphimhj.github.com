## 但是你没有


记得有一次 

我借你的新车去用 

我撞凹了它 

我以为你一定会杀了我的 

但是你没有 


记得有一次 

我拖你去海滩 

而你说天会下雨 

果然下了 

我以为你肯定会说

“我告诉过你啦！” 

但是你没有 


记得那一次 

我向所有的男子挑逗 

来引你嫉妒 

我以为你会离开我 

但是你没有 


记得有一次 

我在你的车里打翻了草莓饼

我以为你一定会厌恶我的 

但你又没有 


记得有一次 

我忘记告诉你那个舞会是穿礼服的 

而只穿了牛仔裤的你大出洋相 

我以为你必然要放弃我了 

但你还是没有…… 


是的

有许多事情你都没有做到 

而你容忍我、钟爱我、保护我 

有许多许多事情我要回报你 

等你从越南回来 

但是你没有



## BUT YOU DIDN’T


Remember the day I borrowed your brand 

new car and dented it? 

I thought you’d kill me, 

but you didn’t. 


And remember the time I dragged you to the beach, 

and you said it would rain, and it did? 

I thought you’d say, “I told you so.” 

But you didn’t. 


Do you remember the time I flirted with all 

the guys to make you jealous, and you were? 

I thought you’d leave, 

but you didn’t. 


Do you remember the time I spilled strawberry pie 

all over your car rug? 

I thought you’d hit me, 

but you didn’t. 


And remember the time I forgot to tell you the dance 

was formal and you showed up in jeans? 

I thought you’d drop me, 

but you didn’t.


Yes, there were lots of things you didn’t do. 

But you put up with me, and loved me, and protected me. 


There were lots of things I wanted to make up to you 

when you returned from Vietnam. 

But you didn’t.
