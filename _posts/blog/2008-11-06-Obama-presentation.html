美国是一个任何事情都有可能发生的国家，对于这一点如果还有任何人心存怀疑，对民主的力量还表示疑虑的话，今晚就是对这一问题的最好回答。

这个答案早已经印在了到处悬挂在学校和教堂的竞选条幅上，人们随处可见；这些人们已经等待了三四个小时，对于他们当中的大多数，这是有生以来第一次经历这样的过程，因为他们坚信这一时刻注定与众不同，而这种不同便有可能源自他们所发出的声音。

这个答案出自这些人之口，无论是青年还是老年，穷人还是富人，民主党还是共和党，黑人还是白人，拉丁裔、亚裔还是美国本土人，同性恋者还是异性恋者，残疾人还是非残疾人——他们向世界发出了这样的信息——我们从来不分红色之州和蓝色之州，我们永远都是美利坚合众国。

这个答案告诉了那些一直以来充满焦虑、恐惧和怀疑的人们，我们可以将双手放在历史的转折点上，将它再次带向充满希望的美好明天。

这一刻我们已经等待了太久，但是今晚，由于我们在这一决定性的时刻所作出的选择，美国便迎来了它崭新的一刻。

我刚刚接到了来自麦凯恩议员的电话。他在这场漫长而艰难的选举中一直努力着，而他为他所热爱的国家所付出的努力甚至更加艰辛而久远。可能我们当中的很 多人甚至都无法想象，麦凯恩议员从何时便开始为我们的国家奉献自己，而我们却早已享受到了这位勇敢无私的领导者为国家所做出的贡献。对于他和佩林所付出的 努力，我表示衷心的感谢，同时我也期待着，能够和他们一同努力，共同实现我们这几个月来所做出的承诺。

我要感谢我的竞选伙伴，新当选的美国副总统乔·拜登，这一路走来，他始终遵循着自己内心深处的那个声音，他始终代表着那些和他一起在斯克兰顿街边长大，一起坐着火车回到故乡特拉华州的人们的声音。

如果没有过去这16年来挚友的支持，没有稳定的家庭和对生活的爱，没有我们国家的下一位第一夫人，米歇尔·奥巴马，今晚我将不可能站在这里。萨莎和玛 丽亚，我爱你们，你们已经得到了一只新的小狗，它将和我们一起入住白宫。还有我的祖母，虽然她已经不能和我们一起分享这一刻，但是我知道，她正和我的家人 一起，注视着我，陪我经历着这一刻。我不会忘记，是他们养育我成人，今晚我是如此的想念他们，我知道，我所亏欠他们的，是永远无法报答的恩情。

对我的竞选负责人大卫·普罗菲，我的首席战略家大卫·亚克瑟罗德以及有史以来最优秀的竞选团队，我想对你们说的是——是你们成就了今天的一切，我将永远感激你们所付出的这一切。

但是，最重要的是，我将永远不会忘记，这个胜利是真正属于你们的！

我一直都不是最有希望的那个候选人，一开始的时候我们便没有那么多的资金或支持。我们的竞选之路并不是从华盛顿的高楼礼堂中开始的，它从德梅因的后院、协和酒店的客厅以及查尔斯顿的门廊中迈出了第一步。

它由那些需要从自己有限的存款中拿出5美元、10美元和20美元的工人们建立起来；那些摒弃了他们那一代人冷漠神话的年轻人，那些远离家乡亲人在外打 拼却只能赚得微薄工资的人们，那些抵抗着刺骨的寒冷和灼人的炎热敲响了陌生人家大门的人们，是你们给了它成长的力量；数以百万计的美国人民自愿组织起来， 他们想要去证明两个多世纪之后，一个由人民组成的政府，一个属于人民的政府，一个为了人民的政府是不会从地球上消亡的，这就是属于你们的胜利！

我知道，你们这样做并不只是想赢得一场选举，我也知道，你们这样做并不是为我一个人。你们这样做，是因为你们了解前方的任务是如何的艰巨。甚至就在我 们庆祝的同时，我们也清楚地明白，明天将要面临的挑战是多么巨大——两大战争，一个处于危险中的星球，本世纪最严重的经济危机。就在我们站在这里的同时， 我们清楚地知道，还有许多勇敢的美国人正在伊拉克的沙漠和阿富汗的群山中醒来，为了我们而冒着生命的危险。还有许许多多的父母们，只有在自己的孩子入睡后 才能躺下，他们为房子的贷款和医院的账单还有孩子们的学费而发愁。放心，我们会注入新的能量，创造新的就业机会，建设新的学校，面对威胁与挑战，修复我们 的联盟。

前方的道路还很漫长。我们所面临的山峰是险峻的。或许一年甚至很长一段时间我们都无法攀上峰顶，但是美国——我从来没有像今晚这样坚信，我们最终一定会到达。我向你保证——我们的民族最终会到达山顶的。

也许会有挫折坎坷，作为总统我所做出的决定和政策必定会遭到一些人的反对，而我们也知道政府不能够解决所有问题。但是我将会诚实地告诉你们我们所面对 的挑战。我会耐心倾听你们的心声，尤其是在遇到分歧的时候。而最重要的是，我将会让你们加入到重建我们国家的队伍当中来，沿着美国这221年来一直所走的 那条道路——一块块砖瓦，一双双手，一点点堆砌出我们的家园。

21个月之前的那个冬天所开始的，不会在这个秋天的夜晚结束。这个胜利本身并不是我们所要找寻的改变——这只是一个改变的机会。如果我们回到老路上，那么一切都不会得到改变。没有你们，这一切也不会得到改变。

那么，就让我们重新召唤起爱国主义、公仆之心以及国家责任的精神来，每个人都参与其中，一起努力，不单只是关心自身，而是互相照顾。让我们记住这场经 济危机所教会我们的一点，如果主街道遭受了打击，那么华尔街也不可能幸免——在这个国家，我们作为一个民族，一个整体，同存亡共荣辱。

让我们摒弃掉那些长久以来一直危害我们的政治生活的那些幼稚琐碎的党派之争。让我们记住，是这个国家的人第一次将共和党的横幅挂在了白宫之上，而共和 党的建立便是基于对自力更生、独立自由和国家统一价值的肯定。这一价值是我们所共享的，即便民主党今晚赢得了大选，我们也会怀着谦虚的心态，去消除这一分 歧和隔膜。在面临着比今天更严重的国家分裂时，林肯说过，“我们不是敌人，而是朋友。。。我们友情的纽带，或会因情绪激动而绷紧，但决不可折断。”而对于 那些我还没有赢得支持的选民们——也许我还没有赢得你们的选票，但是我听到了你们声音，我需要你们的帮助，而我也同样是你们的总统。

对于那些远在大洋彼岸的，在国会和皇宫中，在我们这个世界被遗忘的角落中围在收音机旁关注着大选之夜的人们——我们的故事是不同的，但是我们的命运却 是紧紧连在一起的，美国领袖新的一天的黎明即将到来。对于那些会将世界四分五裂的人们，我们将打败你们，对于那些渴求和平和安全的人们，我们将支持你们。 而对于所有那些想知道，自由女神像手中的火炬是否还会依旧闪耀光芒的人们，今晚我们再次证明了，我们民族的真正实力并不只是来自于武力和财富，而是来自于 我们理想的力量:民主，自由，机遇以及永不屈服的希望。

美国真正的天赋在于，它懂得改变。我们的联盟会不断完善自己。而我们已经取得的成就给了我们希望，让我们坚信我们能够并且即将取得成功。

这次选举拥有许多故事和数不清的第一次，它们将被世世代代流传。但是今晚在我脑海中一直浮现的，是亚特兰大一位女性选民。她就像成千上万的其他选民一样，排在队伍中喊出自己的心声，唯一不同的是——安·尼克松·库伯已经106岁了。

她出生的时候正是奴隶制度解除之后；那时候还没有汽车和飞机；像她一样的人那个时候是没有选举权的，因为她是女人，还因为她皮肤的颜色。

但是今晚，我思考着她所经历的这一个世纪的美国——心痛和希望；斗争与进步；我们被告知我们不能做什么的时代，以及美国人的信条:是的，我们可以！

在那个女性不能发出声音的时代，在那个女性的希望被剥夺的时代，她看着她们站了起来，大声说出自己的想法，投出了自己的选票。是的，我们可以！

当绝望和大萧条袭来的时候，她看到了一个民族通过新政、新的工作和新的共同目的感战胜了恐惧。是的，我们可以！

当炸弹在珍珠港爆炸，当暴政威胁这个世界的时候，她见证了一代人的强大，见证了民主得到了捍卫。是的，我们可以！

她见证了蒙哥马利汽车暴动，见证了塞尔玛大桥事件，遇到了那位来自亚特兰大的牧师，他告诉人们“我们终将会克服一切。”是的，我们可以！

人类登上了月球，柏林墙倒塌了，世界由于我们自身的科学和想象力被连接到了一起。而在这一年，在这次选举中，她的手指触摸到了屏幕，她投出了自己的一票，因为在美国经历了106年的变迁，经历了最好的与最坏的时代后，她了解美国是如何变化的。是的，我们可以！

美国，我们已经走了这么远，我们已经看到了这么多，但是仍然有许多事情等待着我们去做。那么今晚，让我们扪心自问——如果我们的孩子看到了下一个世 纪；如果我的女儿也能够和安·尼克松·库伯一样幸运地活到了106岁，那么他们将会看到怎样的变化？我们又将会取得什么样的进步？

对于我们来说，这正是一个对这一疑问给出回答的机会。这是我们的时刻，这是我们的时代——让我们的人民重新回去工作，为我们的孩子打开机会的大门；积 累财富，促进和平；重拾美国梦，重申基本的真象——相对于大多数而言，我们是独一无二的；当我们呼吸时，我们希望，在我们面对讥笑、怀疑以及别人对我们说 我们不能的时候，我们将会用凝聚了人类精神的永恒信条作出回应:

是的，我们可以！

谢谢你们，愿上帝保佑你们，愿上帝保佑美利坚合众国。

Remarks of President-Elect Barack Obama, as prepared for delivery

Election Night

Tuesday, November 4th, 2008

Chicago, Illinois

If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible; who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time; who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.

It's the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen; by people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the very first time in their lives, because they believed that this time must be different; that their voice could

be that difference.

It's the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled - Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been a collection of Red States and Blue States: we are, and always will be, the United States of America.

It's the answer that led those who have been told for so long by so many to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful of what we can achieve to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day.

It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to America.

I just received a very gracious call from Senator McCain. He fought long and hard in this campaign, and he's fought even longer and harder for the country he loves. He has endured sacrifices for America that most of us cannot begin to imagine, and we are better off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader. I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all they have achieved, and I look forward to working with them to renew this nation's promise in the months ahead.

I want to thank my partner in this journey, a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of Scranton and rode with on that train home to Delaware, the Vice President-elect of the United States, Joe Biden.

I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last sixteen years, the rock of our family and the love of my life, our nation's next First Lady, Michelle Obama.

Sasha and Malia, I love you both so much, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House. And while she's no longer with us, I know my grandmother is watching, along with the family that made me who I am. I miss them tonight, and know that my debt to them is beyond measure.

To my campaign manager David Plouffe, my chief strategist David Axelrod, and the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics - you made this happen, and I am forever grateful for what you've sacrificed to get it done.

But above all, I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to - it belongs to you.

I was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We didn't start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington - it began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston.

It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give five dollars and ten dollars and twenty dollars to this cause. It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy; who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the doors of perfect strangers; from the millions of Americans who volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than two centuries later, a government of the people, by the people and for the people has

not perished from this Earth. This is your victory.

I know you didn't do this just to win an election and I know you didn't do it for me. You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead. For even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime - two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century.

Even as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us. There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after their children fall asleep and wonder how they'll make the mortgage, or pay their doctor's bills, or save enough for college. There is new energy to harness and new jobs to be created; new schools to build and threats to meet and alliances to repair.

The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even one term, but America - I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there. I promise you - we as a people will get there.

There will be setbacks and false starts. There are many who won't agree with every decision or policy I make as President, and we know that government can't solve every problem. But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And above all, I will ask you join in the work of remaking this nation the only way it's been done in America for two-hundred and twenty-one years - block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand.

What began twenty-one months ago in the depths of winter must not end on this autumn night. This victory alone is not the change we seek - it is only the chance for us to make that change. And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were. It cannot happen without you.

So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves, but each other. Let us remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers - in this country, we rise or fall as one nation; as one people.

Let us resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long.

Let us remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House - a party founded on the values of self-reliance, individual liberty, and national unity.

Those are values we all share, and while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress. As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, "We are not enemies, but friends...though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection." And to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn - I may not have won your vote, but I hear your voices, I need your help, and I will be your President too.

And to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of our world - our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand. To those who would tear this world down - we will defeat you. To those who seek peace and security - we support you. And to all those who have wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright - tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from our the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding

hope.

For that is the true genius of America - that America can change. Our union can be perfected. And what we have already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.

This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations. But one that's on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta. She's a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing - Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old.

She was born just a generation past slavery; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons - because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin.

And tonight, I think about all that she's seen throughout her century in America - the heartache and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can't, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes we can.

At a time when women's voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot.

Yes we can.

When there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, new jobs and a new sense of common purpose. Yes we can.

When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved. Yes we can.

She was there for the buses in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma, and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that "We Shall Overcome." Yes we can.

A man touched down on the moon, a wall came down in Berlin, a world was connected by our own science and imagination. And this year, in this election, she touched her finger to a screen, and cast her vote, because after 106 years in America, through the best of times and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change. Yes we can.

America, we have come so far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do. So tonight, let us ask ourselves - if our children should live to see the next century; if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see? What progress will we have made?

This is our chance to answer that call. This is our moment. This is our time - to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth - that out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope, and where we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who tell us that we can't, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a

people:

Yes We Can. Thank you, God bless you, and may God Bless the United States of America.
